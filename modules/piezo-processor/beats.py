"""
Beat-to-beat heartbeat detection from the bed's piezo (ballistocardiogram).

Produces individual heartbeat times — the input HRV analysis and heart-rate-
based sleep staging need — instead of per-minute rate estimates.

Pipeline, per side, on a sliding window (WINDOW_S long, advancing STEP_S; only
beats in the central STEP_S are committed, so every beat is decided with
context on both sides):

1. Band-pass each piezo channel to the cardiac band (HR_BAND, as the rate
   pipeline) and decimate 500 -> 100 Hz. Blank body movement (samples far
   above the heartbeat's own amplitude, plus a margin) so a turn-over can't
   corrupt the rhythm estimate or template of the surrounding windows; no
   beat is taken near, and no interval spans, a blanked stretch.
2. Other-side noise reference: fit a short FIR mapping the other side's
   channels onto this channel (ridge least squares) and subtract it. Vibration
   common to both sides (pump beat frequencies, building, a partner's
   movement) is removed. The other side can also carry THIS sleeper's own
   heartbeat through the mattress, which a blind subtraction would cancel.
   That case is unmistakable: removing your own heartbeat collapses the
   channel's cardiac periodicity (measured ~0.83 -> 0.1-0.26), whereas
   removing common vibration leaves it unchanged or better, and removing a
   partner's coupled heartbeat improves it. So the cleaned channel is used
   unless it loses more than ANC_MAX_QUALITY_DROP of periodicity.
3. Combine the side's two channels: normalise, align the second to the first
   (lag and polarity), weight by periodicity, and keep the combination only
   if it beats the best single channel.
4. Detect beats by template matching: a per-window average heartbeat complex
   (the sleeper's own waveform in their current position) is matched against
   the signal; correlation peaks are beats, refined to sub-sample precision.
   Gaps longer than 1.6 beat periods are searched again at a lower
   threshold. With two good channels, a beat neither channel confirms is
   dropped.
5. Artifact correction (BeatCleaner): intervals outside 20% of the local
   median are rejected (the classic HRV editing criterion, e.g. Kamath &
   Fallen 1995); an extra beat whose two short intervals sum to a normal one
   is removed; a missed beat becomes a break rather than an interpolated
   beat (beat classification after Lipponen & Tarvainen 2019). No interval is
   ever computed across a break.

HRV: RMSSD over the last 5 minutes of clean intervals (Task Force of the ESC
and NASPE, 1996, short-term standard), only when enough of the window is
covered by valid intervals.
